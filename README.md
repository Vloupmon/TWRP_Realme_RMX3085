# Realme 8 4G (RMX3085) TWRP tree

This is a TWRP tree generated from [TWRP device tree generator](https://github.com/SebaUbuntu/TWRP-device-tree-generator) and some fiddling.

The ROM version used is RMX3085export_11_A.19_2021081120010000, although that
shouldn't affect the layout of the partitions much.

It's not guaranted to produce a functional TWRP recovery image at this point.
